# Recruitment task for Megaron SA

Here is a working live **demo** : https://dkurpi.github.io/CallendarSummary.
<br> Made by **Dawid Kurpiel** (*dkurpi*) in 1h10min (*45 min* for functionality, *25 min* for styling/small refactor).

---


## If I had more time, I would:
- **Separate logic** and divide app to smaller components
- Implement **BEM** for naming CSS classes
- Improve code **reusability**
- Improve code **readability**, names of variables/function
- Implement some **design pattern** (for instance: Compound Component pattern)
- Add some **tests**

## Getting Started

1. Go to root directory
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run start`
4. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.
